Welcome!
I am currently working on a DigHum100 project analyzing the lyrics of US Billboard Hot 100 Songs from 1950-2018. I am a recent UC Berkeley grad with a Bachelor of Arts in Cogntive Science and a minor in Data Science. Check out my google colab notebook for this project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M3uG33s0Fw5GbTFT-0bhbLgzyPurx75a/view?usp=sharing).
